@article{Nargis:2024aa,
	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells and involves an interplay between beta cells and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in beta cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our finding demonstrated that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delayed the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets and polarized proinflammatory macrophages revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways and a reduction in interferon response after VLX-1005 treatment. Our studies demonstrated that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.},
